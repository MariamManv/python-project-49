### 'Brain_games' project
The 'Brain_games' project is a collection of five mathematical games developed using Python. In these games, users are presented with various math problems to solve, allowing them to develop their skills and improve their scores.

### Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/MariamManv/python-project-49.git

2. Ensure that Poetry is installed on your local machine. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it by running the following command:

   pip install poetry

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

   cd python-project-49

4. Install the project dependencies by running the command:

   poetry install

5. Run the script of the game, that you want to play:

    brain-even : this game gives you a bunch of numbers, you'll have to detirmine if they're even or not) 

    brain-calc : this game gives you a bunch of mathematical equasions that you'll have to solve)

    brain-gcd : this game gives you two numbers, you'll have to find their grestest common devidor) 

    brain-progression : this game gives you a progression with one missing number, you'll hae ti guess that number)

    brain-prime : this game gives you a bunch of numbers, you'll have to detirmine if they're prime or not)
